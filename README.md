# Assignment 2 - Bitter

This assignment aims to give you:
- experience in constructing a CGI script and Perl/Python programming generally,
- practice in producing a complete CGI-based web site,
- and an introduction to the issues involved in programming for the web.

Note: the material in the lecture notes will not be sufficient by itself to allow you to complete this assignment. You may need to search on-line documentation for CGI, Perl/Python etc. Being able to search documentation efficiently for the information you need is a very useful skill for any kind of computing work.

## Introduction
Andrew has noticed students are often complaining about COMP9041. Rather than address their complaints and improve COMP2041, Andrew has decided he will make himself rich exploiting COMP9041 coding skills and then give up lecturing. Andrew's plan is to have COMP9041 students create a social media platform called Bitter for complaints. Andrew believes the absence of any similar existing social media platform means Bitter will become very popular and he will become rich
Users using Bitter send short messages called bleats. Bleats can have at most maximum 142 characters.

Bitter users can indicate particular users they are interested in and whose bleats they wish to regularly see - this is termed listening to the user.

Your task is to produce a CGI script bitter.cgi which provides the core features of Bitter.

In other words your task is to implement a simple but fully functional social web site.

But don't panic, the assessment for this assignment (see below) will allow you to obtain a reasonable mark if you successfully complete some basic features.
